# Would You Rather

## Project Description

This app was developed as a part of Udacity nano degree program.

This is a quiz app where players can login and vote in different polls.

After the user is logged in he/she can vote in a poll , create a new poll, and view the leaderboard.

The primary purpose for developing this app was to gain
exposure to React & Redux, thus core functionality such as
user authentication and the project backend is mocked.
As a result you will notice that data
does not persist when the browser is refreshed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
